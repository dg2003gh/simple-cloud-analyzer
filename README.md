üîê Cloud Security Analyzer (SCA)

A Python utility for security auditing multi-cloud environments, focused on identifying insecure configurations, public exposures, and misconfigurations in major cloud services.

‚úÖ AWS Analyzer

Audits the following resources on AWS:

- EC2 Security Groups: exposed critical ports.

- RDS: instances in public subnets with open SGs.

- EKS / ECS: public API exposure and use of awsvpc.

- IAM: unused passwords, admin permissions, old keys.

- EBS: unencrypted volumes.

- VPC: public subnets via IGW.

‚úÖ GCP Analyzer

- Audits the following resources on GCP:

- Firewall Rules: rules allowing 0.0.0.0/0.

- Cloud SQL: instances with public IP enabled.

- IAM: custom roles with sensitive permissions.

- GKE: public clusters (without Private Nodes).

- Storage Buckets: public buckets via IAM.

- Persistent Disks: disks without CMEK encryption.

## üöÄ How to Use

### üì¶ Installation

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dg2003gh/simple-cloud-analyzer.git
cd simple-cloud-analyzer
```

Then install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

pip install poetry
poetry install
```

> Make sure you are using **Python 3.13 or higher**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Run the tool with the desired options:

```bash
poetry run python main.py [OPTIONS]
```

#### Example (AWS only):

```bash
poetry run python main.py --providers aws --aws-regions "us-east-1,sa-east-1"
```

#### Example (GCP only):

```bash
poetry run python main.py --providers gcp --gcp-projects "my-prod,my-staging"
```

#### Example (both):

```bash
poetry run python main.py --providers aws gcp --aws-regions "us-east-1" --gcp-projects "my-project-id"
```

üß± Project Infrastructure Overview

üîç Root Directory

This is where the core metadata and entry point of your project reside:

    main.py: Entrypoint of the CLI tool.

    pyproject.toml: Poetry configuration file (dependencies, build system, etc.).

    poetry.lock: Locked dependencies for reproducible builds.

    report.csv: Output file generated by the tool.

    aws_analyzer.log: Likely debug or scan logs.

    README.md: Project documentation.

üß† src/ ‚Äì Application Logic

Contains all the core Python modules grouped by functionality:
‚úÖ modules/:

Structured around separation of concerns:

    cli/

        arg_parser/: Custom CLI argument parser logic.

        table_generator/: Handles formatting outputs into tables (e.g. ASCII tables).

    clouds/

        aws/: AWS-specific analysis logic.

        gcp/: GCP-specific analysis logic.

        provider/: Likely a generic provider interface/handler.

    report_generator/: Code for building and exporting the analysis report.

    utils/: General utility functions or helpers.

    CONSTS.py: Shared constants (like default ports or cloud provider mappings).

Each submodule includes **init**.py files to make them proper Python packages.
üß™ tests/ ‚Äì Testing

This folder likely contains your test suite (although currently only the folder is shown). It should include unit and/or integration tests for your tool.
üìÅ .github/ ‚Äì GitHub Actions

This directory is used to automate workflows (like testing or release) via GitHub Actions. You may have files like:

    workflows/release.yml: Automates build and deployment when you push to the main branch.

üåê docs/ ‚Äì Documentation Website (GitHub Pages)

This folder is being served as your documentation/static site, e.g., at https://dg2003gh.github.io/simple-cloud-analyzer/.

    index.html: Landing page.

    css/: Styling (likely includes style.css).

    imgs/: All images used, including:

        favicon/: Website favicons and icons.

        construction-crane-lifter.svg: Used in the "under construction" placeholder.

    CNAME: Tells GitHub Pages what custom domain (e.g. subdomain from Hostinger) to use.
